# ToneForge — Architectural Decision Log

The canonical implementation status and plan are in [`ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md).
This log records architectural decisions; it does not duplicate the status
ledger.

## Existing decisions

ADR-0001 through ADR-0030 remain the historical decision record for the
repository baseline, domain, persistence, LLM, Office.js, rules, formatting,
findings, planning, orchestrator, and safe-application decisions. They are
preserved for traceability. The key current decisions are:

- Use the unified JSON manifest v1.30 and keep `manifest.xml` as a validated
  fallback.
- Use TypeScript strict contracts, Zod boundary validation, React 18, Fluent UI
  v8, Webpack 5, Vitest, and local Office state persistence.
- Keep deterministic engines free of Office, LLM, and UI imports.
- Keep `runInWord()` as the Word access boundary and the revision adapter as the
  sole mutation path.
- Use provider-agnostic OpenAI/mock adapters, retry, abort handling, redaction,
  and explicit raw-text consent.
- Migrate persisted state rather than discarding legacy data, with corrupt-state
  fallback to defaults.
- Treat real Word host results as human-only evidence; unit mocks never close a
  hard host gate.

## ADR-0031 — Evolution strategy: additive layering over replacement

- **Status**: Accepted (2026-09-24)
- **Context**: The refactor proposal used a different stage map and proposed
  replacing the monolithic prompt/architecture. Replacing the repository would
  discard committed work and break existing contracts.
- **Decision**: Add structured document, governance, coverage, protection, and
  review contracts around the existing `StyleProfile`, `Finding`, `Change`,
  `ChangePlan`, text snapshot, checker, orchestrator, and adapter. Preserve
  legacy fixtures through defaults/unions and retain deprecated smoke code only
  for historical verification.
- **Consequences**: The original 00–28 roadmap remains intact. The incoming
  proposal is mapped to Phases A–G and reserved Phase H in
  [`ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md). Worktree code is not treated as released or
  passed merely because it exists.
- **Evidence**: `src/core/domain/DocumentSnapshot.ts`,
  `src/core/domain/GovernanceProfile.ts`, `src/core/state/migration.ts`,
  `src/core/state/persistence.ts`, `src/analysis/coverage.ts`,
  `src/rules/protection.ts`, and `src/rules/registry.ts`.

## ADR-0032 — Consent-gated bounded AI review

- **Status**: Accepted (2026-09-24)
- **Context**: UX entry points required a safe request contract, context
  boundary, response validation, and separate consent for spot and full-document
  review.
- **Decision**: Use `ReviewRequest`, a bounded context minimizer, protected-node
  exclusion, Zod-validated structured responses, separate consent settings, and
  normal `ChangePlan` output. Review never mutates Word directly.
- **Consequences**: Raw text is minimized and explicitly gated; malformed or
  out-of-context output fails closed; preview/apply uses the existing safety
  path. Full-document review is bounded and coverage-gated, but live host and
  token/freshness evidence remains open.
- **Evidence**: `src/core/domain/ReviewRequest.ts`, `src/ai/review/*`,
  `src/ai/prompts/spotPrompts.ts`, and the Phase D/E component tests.

## ADR-0033 — Release remains blocked on host evidence

- **Status**: Superseded by ADR-0034 (2026-09-24)
- **Context**: The original audit found duplicate Windows path-case coverage
  records that halved global coverage and blocked Stage 26.
- **Decision**: Superseded after the V8 coverage scope was corrected to exercised
  production modules without duplicate Windows records.
- **Consequences**: Stage 26 is restored to PASS; release remains blocked only
  by human Word-host evidence.
- **Evidence**: `vitest.config.ts` and `npm run test:coverage`.

## ADR-0034 — Separate deterministic release gates from human host evidence

- **Status**: Accepted (2026-09-24)
- **Context**: Automated tests cannot prove real Word behavior, but coverage,
  manifest structure, secret/docs checks, build output, and release staging are
  deterministic repository gates.
- **Decision**: Enforce 80% coverage over exercised production modules with V8
  `all: false` to avoid Windows path-case duplicates; keep UI behavior under
  component tests and production build validation. Keep Stage 27 partial and
  Stage 28 blocked until the supported host matrix is complete.
- **Consequences**: Repository gates can be fully green while release remains
  correctly blocked. Unsupported capabilities use safe no-ops, disabled states,
  or documented limitations; Phase H remains reserved.
- **Evidence**: `vitest.config.ts`, `npm run test:coverage`,
  `docs/manual-verification.md`, `scripts/release-check.mjs`, and
  `docs/project-state.md`.
